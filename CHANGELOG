TxREP - Reputation Plugin for SpamAssassin
==========================================

v1.0.5  2014/03/06  Ivo Truxa
 * BF(6908) at spam scores we'll use the connecting IP from the first untursted 
   relay (preferebaly, if exists), or the last available IP from trusted relay
   At ham scores, we assume no spoofing, and go for the last public IP as it was 
   previously at AWL.
 * CHG: EnvelopeFrom:addr now used when no From:addr available
 * CHG: HELO names now better checked against redundancy with IP's and domains

v1.0.4  2014/03/06  Ivo Truxa
 * BF:  Missing return value in open_storages prevented the 1st MSG_ID lookup
 * ENH: Added time stamp into the signedby field at the MSG_ID entry in the database
