TxREP - Reputation Plugin for SpamAssassin
==========================================

v1.0.11 2014/03/29  Ivo Truxa
 * ENH: added call extract_message_metadata when called through the sub
        learn_message, to allow parsing of header metadata while learning 
        too  (allows the extracting of IP address and HELO names)

v1.0.10 2014/03/28  Ivo Truxa
 * BF:  corrected score (divided by the count) when forgetting a learned
        message before re-learning it. It wrongly deduced the score twice
        in some cases. 
 * BF:  Change necessary in SQLBasedAddrList.pm to allow forgetting of
        messages (decrementing the counter). DBBasedAddrList.pm is OK

v1.0.9  2014/03/18  Ivo Truxa
 * ENH: HELO name records are now tagged by the keyword HELO in the signedby
        filed (otherwise unused at HELO records). This is to better avoid
        mistaking a HELO name for IP address, domain, or email. HELO records
        from earlier version will not be recognized; need to be relearned
        and recorded with the HELO tag.

v1.0.8  2014/03/14  Ivo Truxa
 * BF:  removed doubled "defined" from open_storages() sub
 * ENH: more foolproof checking at dual storages, avoiding duplicate records 

v1.0.7  2014/03/11  Ivo Truxa
 * ENH: new option txrep_spf to enable/disable suppressing of IPs at SPF pass
 * ENH: no IP address is recorded at SPF pass (when txrep_spf enabled)

v1.0.6  2014/03/08  Ivo Truxa
 * BF(AWL6357) whe message comes from internal networks, the IP is now set to
   127.0.0.1, to distinguish it from possibly forged 'none' IP or new emails

v1.0.5  2014/03/08  Ivo Truxa
 * BF(AWL6908) at spam scores we'll use the connecting IP from the first untursted 
   relay (preferebaly, if exists), or the last available IP from trusted relay
   At ham scores, we assume no spoofing, and go for the last public IP as it was 
   previously at AWL.
 * CHG: EnvelopeFrom:addr now used when no From:addr available
 * CHG: HELO names now better checked against redundancy with IP's and domains

v1.0.4  2014/03/06  Ivo Truxa
 * BF:  Missing return value in open_storages prevented the 1st MSG_ID lookup
 * ENH: Added time stamp into the signedby field at the MSG_ID entry in the database
 * ENH: Added setting 'txrep_expiry_days'
 * ENH: Added plugin hook sub learner_expire_old_training (not working yet, dummy sub)

v1.0.3  2014/03/06  Ivo Truxa
 * BF:  DKIM signatures were not stored due to a duplicate variable declaration
 * ENH: avoiding duplicate entries with HELO equal to the IP or the domain name

v1.0.2  2014/03/05  Ivo Truxa
 * CHG: Debug message at reopening the db removed

v1.0.1  2014/03/05  Ivo Truxa
 * BF: sa-learning failed at empty arrays for untrusted or external relays

v1.0.0  2014/03/05  Ivo Truxa
 * Intiail release
